# SatoLOC Insight — AI Visibility: Competitive Edge & UX Improvements

## Why this creates a competitive edge

Most AI visibility tools only track **keywords** and maybe “brand + keyword” in AI answers. SatoLOC closes the loop: **keywords → real-user prompts (in your language) → run on LLMs → citation tracking → content actions for gaps.** That’s **prompt-first, multi-language citation intelligence** with a direct path from insight to content.

## Differentiators (implemented in prototype)

| Differentiator | What we do | Why it matters |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Prompt-first** | Generate the exact prompts people ask Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini — then run them | You’re not guessing; you measure what actually drives citations |
| **Multi-language & region** | Add keywords → choose languages (EN, TR, DE, FR, ES, JA, PT) and regions → prompts generated and run in that language | Only tracker that runs localized prompts across 4 engines |
| **Links per LLM** | Expand any row to see snippet + brand/competitor links **per engine** (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) | You see exactly who each engine cited, not just “cited yes/no” |
| **Run → table update** | Click “Run on LLMs” → row appears in Citation Tracking with “Checking…” → results fill in; toast when ready | Live feedback and no context switching |
| **One-click content** | “Create content” from a prompt or action plan → Custom Content editor pre-filled with that prompt as the brief | Citation gap → content brief in one click |
| **Filters** | Filter table by language and citation status (cited / not cited) | Focus on gaps or on a specific market |
| **Live overview** | Total Citations card includes runs from “Add keywords & generate prompts” | Dashboard reflects your runs immediately |
| **Run all drafts** | “Run all drafts” in the modal to run every generated prompt at once | Power users can scale tracking without clicking one by one |
| **Toast on completion** | When a run finishes, a toast says “Citation results ready — [keyword]” | Users get feedback even if they’re not looking at the table |

## Further improvements (roadmap)

### High impact

1. **Trend over time**  
   Per keyword/prompt: citation rate or “cited in N of 4 engines” over 7d / 30d / 90d. Lets you show “we’re improving” or “we’re losing share.”

2. **Alerts**  
   “Your brand was just cited for [prompt]” or “Competitor X is now cited and you’re not for [keyword].” In-app and/or email/Slack.

3. **Benchmark view**  
   For a given prompt, show side-by-side: you vs Phrase vs Lokalise (who each engine cited and with what link). “Competitive citation snapshot.”

4. **Scheduled runs**  
   “Run these prompts weekly” so tracking is continuous and comparable over time.

### UX polish

5. **Onboarding**  
   First-time: short tooltip or step-through on “Add keywords & generate prompts” and “Run on LLMs” so the value is obvious.

6. **Bulk export**  
   Export citation table (and/or action plan) as CSV for reporting and share of voice decks.

7. **Keyboard & a11y**  
   Escape to close modal; focus trap in modal; aria-labels and live regions for toasts and “Checking…” so screen readers get updates.

8. **Empty state copy**  
   On first visit: “Run your first prompt in 3 steps: Add keywords → Generate prompts → Run on LLMs. Results appear in the table below.”

### Strategic

9. **Reddit + AI Search link**  
   From Reddit Brand Dashboard: “Track this topic in AI Search” so community insight flows into citation tracking.

10. **API / webhooks**  
    Notify external systems when citation status changes (e.g. Slack, CRM) for enterprises.

11. **Multi-brand / agency**  
    Switch context by brand or client so agencies can manage multiple AI visibility accounts.

## Messaging that sells

- **Headline:** “The only AI visibility platform that generates the prompts people ask, runs them in your language, and turns citation gaps into content briefs.”
- **One-liner:** “Keywords → prompts → run on 4 LLMs → see where you’re cited and create content for gaps.”
- **vs others:** “Others track keywords. We track the exact prompts and show you per-engine links and one-click content actions.”
